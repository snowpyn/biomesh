# P4-WP06 Portable Projects and Packaging

P4-WP06 adds a deterministic exchange format for P4-WP01 projects and a
documented Linux application installer path. It changes no model, parameter,
plugin-trust, registry, queue-resource, cancellation, recovery, raw-artifact,
or report contract.

## Portable project archive

A `.biomesh` archive is a stored, deterministic ZIP with fixed metadata. New
archives use strict schema-version 2 `archive.json`, which identifies the
BioMesh version, project, source and portable project hashes, calibration
boundary, inclusion policy, and every carried regular file by role, byte size,
and SHA-256. The payload is:

- a portable `project.json` whose accepted fixture references point to embedded
  hash-verified fixture bytes;
- `campaign_state.json` rebound only to that portable definition hash;
- the fixture configurations plus all five exact registry-selected biological
  parameter documents required by the accepted campaign executor; and
- every artifact and completion receipt for each hash-verified completed run.

Parameter resources are stored at contained paths that preserve the fixture's
relative references. Their bytes are checksum-inventoried and cross-checked
against the prospective execution identity before import and again before
execution. Plugin code/trust, registry documents/trust, and queue state remain
non-transferable; carrying exact selection hashes as provenance grants none of
them.

The archive retains all completed raw-run bytes and artifact records. Existing
Parquet/NumPy/JSON output is already the compact canonical result surface; no
lossy summary or new scientific interpretation replaces it. Pending and failed
runs remain explicit. Export rejects running work, symlinks, unexpected or
unpublished artifact paths, fixture drift, and any completed-artifact mismatch.
The source project is held under its campaign lock and is never rewritten.

Current completion receipts have one shared exact field contract across the
campaign and archive verifiers. The already-governed P6 `portable_trace` may be
present only as the sole optional top-level field and must be a JSON object;
untraced P4 receipts omit it. Null, list, scalar, unknown-field, and legacy
extensions fail closed. Archive export does not ignore or remove a hidden
staging path: first use the supported campaign/queue stale-recovery boundary,
which may reconcile only the exact empty staging directory associated with a
known interrupted run. Unsafe or uncertain staging state remains unexportable
and untouched.

Use new targets for all operations:

```bash
python -m biomesh project export PROJECT_DIRECTORY \
  --output NEW_PROJECT_ARCHIVE.biomesh
python -m biomesh project verify-archive PROJECT_ARCHIVE.biomesh \
  --allow-unauthenticated
python -m biomesh project import PROJECT_ARCHIVE.biomesh \
  NEW_PROJECT_DIRECTORY --allow-unauthenticated
```

Verification rejects duplicate, encrypted, compressed, non-regular,
out-of-root, missing, or extra members; a 100,000-file and 64 GiB expanded-size
ceiling bounds archive processing. Every payload byte must match its recorded
size and SHA-256 before import. Import writes into a temporary sibling,
recreates the process lock, validates the complete project through
`CampaignService`, then publishes atomically.

Legacy archive/project schema version 1 remains verifiable and importable for
historical completed results. An unfinished legacy project cannot be exported
as executable or resumed because missing model/plugin provenance is never
backfilled. Completed bytes and legacy receipts remain unchanged.

SHA-256 detects accidental corruption; it is not a digital signature or proof
of author identity. No plugin, plugin approval, registry export, registry trust,
or queue state is carried or inferred. Re-enqueue an imported project
explicitly if local queue execution is wanted. Import never grants third-party
plugin trust.

## Clean-clone or installed reproduction

The tracked P4-WP06 manufactured validation definition remains
`validation/p4_wp06/project.json`. The P4A audit authority uses the broader
`experiments/platform_reference.yaml`: two accepted manufactured conditions at
fixed seeds 101, 202, and 303. Both remain `CALIBRATION_REQUIRED`
software-validation input. A pending-archive reproduction path is:

```bash
python -m biomesh project create experiments/platform_reference.yaml SOURCE_PROJECT
python -m biomesh project export SOURCE_PROJECT --output project.biomesh

# Run these commands outside the clone with an installed BioMesh package.
biomesh project verify-archive /path/to/project.biomesh --allow-unauthenticated
biomesh project import /path/to/project.biomesh IMPORTED_PROJECT \
  --allow-unauthenticated
biomesh campaign resume IMPORTED_PROJECT platform-reference
biomesh campaign status IMPORTED_PROJECT platform-reference
```

The imported pending campaign completes all six runs without the source clone.
Separately, archives carrying completed artifacts and receipts preserve every
source byte and pass the immutable completed-run verifier. This establishes
portable software reproduction, not biological calibration or experimental
validity.

## Linux application package

The Linux build consumes exactly one BioMesh wheel and publishes a new
architecture-labelled `.tar.gz` containing the wheel, `install.sh`,
`INSTALL.md`, `PROVENANCE.json`, and `SHA256SUMS`. Tar and gzip timestamps,
ownership, permissions, and member order are fixed for reproducible bundle
bytes.

Build with Python 3.14 from a clean clone:

```bash
python3.14 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]" hatchling
python -m biomesh provenance build --source . --output dist
python -m biomesh provenance verify dist/biomesh-0.5.0-provenance.json
```

Extract and install for the current user:

```bash
tar -xzf dist/biomesh-*-linux-*.tar.gz
cd biomesh-*-linux-*
./install.sh --install
biomesh --version
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen biomesh-gui --smoke-test
```

The installer requires Linux and Python 3.14, verifies `SHA256SUMS`, installs
the wheel plus declared dependencies under a new `${HOME}/.local` versioned
directory, and creates CLI/GUI launchers. P5-WP05 now supersedes the one-shot
P4 lifecycle with supply-verified side-by-side install, upgrade, rollback,
recovery, and ownership-safe uninstall; see
`docs/P5_WP05_INSTALLER_LIFECYCLE.md`. `--prefix ABSOLUTE_PATH` and
`--python PYTHON3.14` select an alternate location/interpreter. The `--no-deps`
option is only for controlled verification where the exact runtime dependencies
already exist.

P5-WP02 supersedes the former direct Hatchling/`package linux` publication
path with the provenance-bound whole-set command above. The accepted P4-WP06
archive and installer behavior is unchanged; publishable P5 artifacts now
require the additional exact clean-source and cross-artifact verification in
`docs/P5_WP02_INSTALLED_BUILD_PROVENANCE.md`.

P5-WP03 supersedes the raw archive trust entry point: the raw P4 format is
legacy unsigned input and therefore requires the explicit options shown above,
with durable `UNAUTHENTICATED` status. Prefer the signed and optionally
confidential commands and host-owned trust policy documented in
`docs/P5_WP03_ARCHIVE_SECURITY_POLICY.md`; the inner P4 bytes and all validation
in this document remain unchanged.

The bundle builder fails if the wheel contains generated project, queue,
report, raw-run, archive, CSV, Parquet, or NumPy-result data. Packaged
manufactured experiment definitions and unresolved parameter resources remain
configuration, not generated research data. User `.biomesh` archives are
always exchanged separately and explicitly.

## Migration and scope boundary

Archive/project schema version 1 has the explicit historical compatibility
behavior described above. For version 2, the imported definition changes only
external fixture locations to archive-contained relative paths and updates the
matching state definition hash. Run plans, audit sequences, run IDs, status,
artifact records, raw bytes, and completion receipts remain equal.

P4-WP06 adds no GUI archive action, automatic queue rebinding, remote service,
cloud behavior, installer auto-update, archive signing, automatic plugin trust,
registry reinterpretation, acceleration prototype, biological parameter,
scientific mechanism, calibration result, or P4A acceptance result.
