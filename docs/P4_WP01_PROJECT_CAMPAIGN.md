# P4-WP01 Project and Campaign Model

P4-WP01 adds a local, synchronous persistence boundary above the accepted P3
`ApplicationService`. It does not change the P1–P3 engine, GUI, biological
parameter schemas, update order, artifacts, or calibration status.

## Versioned records

New `project.json` files use strict top-level `schema_version = 2`; the nested
project, experiment, and campaign records remain version 1. Version 2 requires
one immutable `execution_identity` before any run can start. It binds the
complete built-in registry SHA-256, every named/versioned model and
parameter-set record used by the accepted P2 fixture executor, each exact
parameter-source SHA-256, and the canonical plugin-set SHA-256 for an explicit
empty selection. The accepted campaign executor still loads zero plugins and
accepts only this code-owned identity.

The original top-level `schema_version = 1` remains readable for status,
artifact verification, reporting, and completed-result archive exchange. It
has no execution identity, so pending/retry execution and provenance
backfilling fail explicitly. Historical completed results and their version 1
receipts are never rewritten in place.

The immutable project definition otherwise contains:

- `ProjectRecord` stores project identity, title, and purpose.
- `ExperimentRecord` binds an experiment to an exact fixture SHA-256 and keeps
  its overall status `CALIBRATION_REQUIRED`.
- `CampaignRecord` identifies the experiment, replicate count, seed policy,
  and explicit sweep matrix.
- `SweepPoint` names one accepted fixture condition and repeats its exact
  SI-labelled, source-, uncertainty-, notes-, and calibration-status-complete
  parameter overrides. A mismatch fails before project creation or execution.

`campaign_state.json` is mutable only through an atomic sibling-file replace:

- `RunRecord` carries a deterministic run ID, point, replicate index, seed,
  status, attempt count, artifacts, and an explicit retryable failure.
- `ArtifactRecord` binds every completed output file to its contained relative
  path, byte size, and SHA-256.
- `AuditRecord` is an append-only, contiguous sequence of lifecycle actions.
  It avoids wall-clock values so equal action sequences remain deterministic.

The project directory also contains `.campaign.lock` and `artifacts/<run-id>`.
The lock serializes process mutations; it is not a P4-WP05 run queue.

## Seeds and sweep matrix

An `explicit` seed policy requires exactly one unique nonnegative seed per
replicate. A `sequence` policy requires a nonnegative start and positive step.
Run planning expands sweep points in definition order and replicates in seed
order, then derives stable path-safe run IDs from the complete plan identity.

P4-WP01 does not create arbitrary configuration-to-engine behavior. Every
sweep point must select an existing condition from its hash-bound accepted P2
fixture, and its parameter records must equal that condition's existing
overrides byte-for-semantics. Unknown biological records remain configurable
and `CALIBRATION_REQUIRED`; manufactured fixture values are not calibration or
biological evidence.

## Resume, completion, and retry

Before a run, state is atomically persisted as `running`. The executor writes
to a sibling staging directory. Successful output is hashed, and a version 2
completion receipt records the full execution identity plus its canonical
SHA-256 before the directory is atomically published and state is marked
`completed`. The real accepted executor records the same identity in
`run_request.json` before invoking the unchanged P3 application service.

On resume, a prior `running` record with no published receipt becomes an
explicit `interrupted` failure. A published receipt is accepted only when its
run identity, attempt, file set, sizes, and hashes all validate. Completed runs
are never scheduled by resume or retry, and any later artifact change fails
closed. Failed runs retain their error and attempt count until `campaign retry`
is explicitly requested.

If process death bypasses staging cleanup, the recovery path may remove only
one empty, nonsymlinked direct child named exactly
`.<running-run-id>.<eight Python-3.14 tempfile characters>`. The run must be the
sole `running` run in the requested campaign, its canonical
`artifacts/<run-id>` path must be absent, and every other direct artifact path,
completed receipt, and completed byte must validate first. Recovery records
the staging device/inode, reopens and rechecks the same empty directory, uses
nonrecursive `rmdir`, and only then writes the explicit interruption. It never
follows or deletes a symlink, non-directory, nonempty/nested stage, malformed
or ambiguous name, unknown/non-running/completed-run lookalike, canonical
completed directory, or arbitrary operator file. Such state fails explicitly
without cleanup or state/artifact mutation. Ordinary status/report verification
does not hide an unreconciled staging directory; use the supported resume,
retry, or P4-WP05 stale-worker recovery boundary.

## CLI application paths

```text
python -m biomesh project create DEFINITION.json PROJECT_DIRECTORY
python -m biomesh campaign status PROJECT_DIRECTORY CAMPAIGN_ID
python -m biomesh campaign resume PROJECT_DIRECTORY CAMPAIGN_ID
python -m biomesh campaign retry PROJECT_DIRECTORY CAMPAIGN_ID [--run-id RUN_ID]
```

`resume` and `retry` execute sequentially through the public P3 service and
preserve its exact fixture, deterministic seed, solver-boundary, and canonical
raw-export contracts. A failed run does not stop independent pending runs, but
either operation returns exit status 1 while retryable failures remain. Input,
schema, or persistence errors return exit status 2.

## Migration and scope boundary

Top-level schema version 1 has the explicit read-only compatibility behavior
above; no project or completed result is migrated in place. P3 recent-project
entries remain opaque paths, and existing standalone run directories are not
silently adopted or rewritten. Portable archive import/export belongs to
P4-WP06.

The accepted execution identity is provenance and compatibility metadata only;
it does not make registry data executable or load a plugin. P4-WP01 includes no
comparison/report metrics, persistent background queue, priorities,
cancellation, Linux packaging, archive transport, GPU/3D path, cloud behavior,
or new scientific mechanism.
