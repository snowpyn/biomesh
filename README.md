# BioMesh

BioMesh is a deterministic, 2D bacterial biofilm simulation platform under
development. It combines a configurable scientific-model core with
reproducible validation and experiment-fixture workflows, and is being shaped
into a Linux desktop research platform.

## Current status

The latest accepted phase is **P5 – Phase 5 – Security and Distribution
Hardening**, represented by `v0.5.1-audit`. P6-WP01 through P6-WP04 are
implemented on the Phase 6 branch, and `v0.6.0` freezes that implementation for
the still-required independent P6A portability audit. Production findings
P6A-001 and P6A-002 are remediated on the implementation branch, but Phase 6
is not accepted and requires a fresh independent audit rerun.

The current desktop GUI has menus, docks, status, recent project references, an
error console, separate UI preferences, a snapshot-only simulation viewer, a
schema-generated biological-parameter editor, solver-boundary controls,
checkpoint interaction, and immutable cell inspection. A small background
worker owns the synchronous application API and controls only the existing
manufactured P2 fixture path. Snapshot-only live plots show the existing
population, biomass, producer-frequency, EPS, quorum-response, thickness,
roughness, and penetration-depth metrics. Completed runs export atomically as
PNG plots, exact CSV/Parquet analytics, canonical Parquet tables and NumPy
fields, and a provenance-complete run manifest.

See [the authoritative phase tracker](docs/PHASE_STATUS.md) and the
[current project state](docs/PROJECT_STATE.md) for the live status.

## What is implemented

The repository currently provides:

- a configurable P1 core for carbon and oxygen finite-volume fields, capsule
  cells, metabolism, mechanics, accounting, deterministic outputs, and replay;
- P2 colony-system components for quorum signal, EPS, producer/nonproducer
  competition, physiological states, waste, and simplified shear exposure;
- strict experiment and sweep fixtures with fixed seeds, provenance manifests,
  raw Parquet/NumPy artifacts, replicate statistics, descriptive rankings, and
  report plots;
- CLI validation, reference-run reproduction, experiment/sweep execution, and
  campaign reporting;
- the P3-WP01 typed, synchronous application-service boundary for run, pause,
  step, checkpoint/resume, inspection, snapshots, and canonical export; and
- the P3-WP02 PySide6 desktop shell with menus, dockable project/error panels,
  status reporting, recent file references, and UI-only XDG preferences; and
- the P3-WP03 PyQtGraph viewer for immutable cell geometry and scalar fields,
  with zoom, pan, fit, layer visibility/opacity, legends, and frame limiting;
  and
- the P3-WP04 editor for the existing validated biological-parameter schemas,
  with provenance display, explicit validation, semantic TOML round-trip,
  editable templates, and hash-bound read-only audited presets; and
- the P3-WP05 worker, exact P2 fixture/condition/seed controls, deterministic
  pause/step/stop behavior, speed target, checkpoint/resume interaction, and
  snapshot-based cell inspection; and
- the P3-WP06 immutable-snapshot analytics panel and cancellable background
  export bundle with PNG, CSV, Parquet, canonical fields/tables, hashes,
  calibration status, seed, commit, and software-version provenance; and
- deterministic P3 frontend-equivalence and checkpoint-replay verification
  commands over a manufactured `CALIBRATION_REQUIRED` reference selector; and
- the P4 versioned local project/campaign model plus presentation-neutral
  comparison/report JSON and CSV with raw-run hash/row traceability, explicit
  missing-run coverage, single-seed warnings, and prospective exact
  model/parameter-registry plus zero-plugin-set execution identity; and
- the P4 versioned plugin boundary for species, kinetics, fields, metrics, and
  exporters, with whole-set compatibility/trust preflight, deterministic
  provenance manifests, zero-plugin operation, and a packaged uncalibrated
  species/kinetics example; and
- the P5 least-privilege Linux plugin runtime with out-of-process Bubblewrap/
  libseccomp isolation, versioned bounded immutable messages, explicit resource
  limits and receipts, atomic failure, and a no-process zero-plugin path; and
- the P4 named/versioned model and parameter registry with hash-bound immutable
  audited presets, explicit provenance categories, citations and uncertainty,
  deterministic import/export, SI compatibility checks, and exact reviewed
  plugin preflight; and
- the P4 persistent local campaign queue with deterministic priorities,
  run-level progress, exact Linux CPU/memory enforcement, targeted
  cancellation, and restart recovery that preserves immutable completed runs;
- P6 schema-1 portable queue intent, strict non-runnable import and explicit
  path/resource binding, fresh local activation, retry/recovery traceability,
  read-only migration status, and no-publication dry-run preflight; and
- deterministic portable project export/verification/import with embedded
  hash-bound fixtures and all required biological parameter documents, exact
  completed-run artifacts, per-file SHA-256, and clean-install execution of
  imported pending campaigns; and
- a reproducible Linux wheel-installer bundle whose build gate rejects
  generated project, queue, report, raw-run, and research-result data; and
- an isolated versioned benchmark interface with a disabled-by-default NumPy
  CPU feasibility candidate, explicit CPU divergence measurement, optional raw
  timing observations, and no 3D/GPU/scientific/performance claim.

These are software capabilities and reproducibility contracts. They do not by
themselves establish that the model is biologically calibrated or experimentally
validated.

## Validation and scientific scope

The P1 and P2 independent audits accepted the implemented software paths with
recorded limitations. The repository verifies deterministic behavior,
validation cases, accounting, provenance, artifact schemas, and byte-identical
replay for the published fixture workflows.

All biological values remain configurable and `CALIBRATION_REQUIRED`. The
reference run and published P2 fixtures are manufactured software-validation
inputs, not biological calibration data or experimental results. In particular,
the repository does not claim biological calibration, experimental or clinical
validation, clinical suitability, or production readiness. P2's EPS field is
immobile, shear is a simplified non-CFD exposure abstraction, and sensitivity
rankings are descriptive observed ranges rather than global sensitivity
analysis.

Read [LIMITATIONS.md](LIMITATIONS.md) for the complete limitations record and
[the biological assumptions](docs/BIOLOGICAL_ASSUMPTIONS.md) for the documented
model assumptions.

## Installation

BioMesh currently requires Python **3.14** (`>=3.14,<3.15`) and targets Linux.
The development install includes the runtime and verification tools:

```bash
python3.14 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

The project uses the newest stable Python version fully supported by all
required dependencies. Do not silently substitute another Python version if a
dependency compatibility problem appears.

Reviewed non-empty plugin execution additionally requires Linux Bubblewrap
0.8.0 or newer, util-linux `prlimit`, and libseccomp. Missing or mismatched
sandbox enforcement fails before plugin code runs.

## Quick start

From the repository root, confirm the CLI and run the core validation paths:

```bash
python -m biomesh --help
python -m biomesh validate diffusion
python -m biomesh validate growth
python -m biomesh validate mass-balance
python -m biomesh run
python -m biomesh reproduce
```

To validate the published fixture definitions and run one complete manufactured
P2 experiment, use a new output directory:

```bash
python -m biomesh validate all
python -m biomesh experiment experiments/producer.yaml \
  --output outputs/producer-experiment-demo
python -m biomesh report outputs/producer-experiment-demo
```

The experiment command prints the generated campaign directory. The report
command validates that directory and writes `report.png` inside it. Output
directories must not already exist; generated contents under `outputs/` are
ignored by Git and should not be committed.

Launch the shell on Linux with `biomesh-gui` or `python -m biomesh.gui`. A
headless startup check is available for development and CI:

```bash
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen python -m biomesh.gui --smoke-test
```

The minimum supported desktop display is 1024×720. Rich dock contents remain
scrollable at that size. Standard Tab/Shift+Tab navigation reaches the run
selectors, every lifecycle/checkpoint control when enabled, speed target,
viewer controls, and editor inputs. Standard Alt menu navigation reaches the
project and export actions; Ctrl+O opens a project reference and Ctrl+Q exits.

The reproducible P3 verification reference runs the existing producer fixture
at independent deterministic seed 42. It adds no biological value and does not
expand the desktop's accepted P2 seed choices:

```bash
python -m biomesh compare-frontends parameters/phase2_reference.yaml --seed 42
python -m biomesh verify-checkpoint outputs/p3a-reference-seed-42
```

The first command atomically writes byte-identical CLI and application-service
artifact trees, a hash-bound checkpoint, and `frontend_equivalence.json`. The
second reconstructs that checkpoint and byte-compares the replay with the
stored uninterrupted application artifacts. Both outputs remain manufactured
software-verification evidence and preserve `CALIBRATION_REQUIRED` status.

For a completed P4 project campaign, generate a new comparison/report data
directory with:

```bash
python -m biomesh campaign report PROJECT_DIRECTORY CAMPAIGN_ID \
  --output NEW_REPORT_DIRECTORY
```

The report contains deterministic JSON plus CSV coverage, observations,
condition summaries, and pairwise comparisons. Each value retains raw artifact
hash and row provenance. Missing runs and single-seed limitations remain
visible; the report does not generate a scientific conclusion or calibration
claim. See [the P4-WP01 project model](docs/P4_WP01_PROJECT_CAMPAIGN.md) and
[the P4-WP02 report contract](docs/P4_WP02_COMPARISON_REPORTS.md).

The tracked P4 platform reference is
`experiments/platform_reference.yaml`. It selects two accepted manufactured
quorum-threshold conditions at fixed seeds 101, 202, and 303. It is a
deterministic, multi-condition software-validation project with complete SI and
provenance records; its biological inputs remain `CALIBRATION_REQUIRED`. It is
not a biological experiment or calibration result.

Verify the zero-plugin core contract and the exact reviewed packaged example
with:

```bash
python -m biomesh plugins verify
python -m biomesh plugins verify --output NEW_DIRECTORY
```

The optional output is atomically published as `plugin_manifest.json` with the
plugin API/version, distribution and entry-point identity,
selection/metadata SHA-256, review reference, calibration status, limitations,
and deterministic self-check. A plugin manifest alone is not trusted:
incompatible or unreviewed sets fail before any entry point is loaded. See
[the P4-WP03 plugin contract](docs/P4_WP03_PLUGIN_API.md).

Verify or exchange the deterministic model/parameter registry with:

```bash
python -m biomesh registry verify
python -m biomesh registry export --output NEW_REGISTRY_DIRECTORY
python -m biomesh registry import REGISTRY_FILE_OR_DIRECTORY \
  --output NEW_REGISTRY_DIRECTORY
```

The built-in catalog hash-verifies the five accepted biological-parameter
TOML files, preserves every SI unit and provenance placeholder, and prevents
modified or relabelled records from acquiring audited status. Preflight can
check an exact model/parameter-set version and its zero/reviewed plugin set
before any caller launches work; it emits only traceable content hashes and
does not itself execute a simulation. See
[the P4-WP04 registry contract](docs/P4_WP04_MODEL_PARAMETER_REGISTRY.md).

Create and operate one local queue with explicit worker resource limits:

```bash
python -m biomesh queue create QUEUE_DIRECTORY \
  --cpu-cores CPU_COUNT --memory-limit-bytes BYTES
python -m biomesh queue enqueue QUEUE_DIRECTORY PROJECT_DIRECTORY CAMPAIGN_ID \
  --priority PRIORITY
python -m biomesh queue status QUEUE_DIRECTORY
python -m biomesh queue run QUEUE_DIRECTORY
python -m biomesh queue cancel QUEUE_DIRECTORY QUEUE_ID
```

The worker applies exact Linux CPU affinity and an address-space byte cap before
claiming work. Higher priorities run first and equal priorities remain FIFO.
Queue status exposes campaign run counts during execution; cancellation and
restart recovery retain completed artifact bytes and leave exactly one affected
attempt as an explicit retryable cancellation failure before the queue becomes
terminal `cancelled`. Cancellation targets the exact persisted Linux
PID/process-start identity through a pidfd, and explicit retry under a fresh
worker schedules only retained failed work. Unowned campaign-state atomic
temporary siblings fail closed and remain untouched. Queue references remain
local absolute paths.
See [the P4-WP05 queue contract](docs/P4_WP05_LOCAL_RUN_QUEUE.md).

For clean-install queue-intent migration, explicit destination rebinding,
activation, dry-run, recovery, and report trace comparison, follow the
[P6 operational migration contract](docs/P6_WP04_OPERATIONAL_MIGRATION.md).

Exchange a project without depending on its original fixture location:

```bash
python -m biomesh project export PROJECT_DIRECTORY \
  --output NEW_PROJECT_ARCHIVE.biomesh
python -m biomesh project verify-archive PROJECT_ARCHIVE.biomesh \
  --allow-unauthenticated
python -m biomesh project import PROJECT_ARCHIVE.biomesh \
  NEW_PROJECT_DIRECTORY --allow-unauthenticated
```

The archive carries strict self-description, embedded hash-verified fixture
configuration, every required hash-verified biological parameter document,
project/campaign manifests, exact completed-run artifacts and receipts, and a
per-file size/SHA-256 inventory. Pending and failed work remains explicit.
Plugin code/trust, registry documents/trust, and local queue state are neither
embedded nor inferred; imported projects must be intentionally re-enqueued.
New runs record the exact built-in registry/model/parameter selections and the
canonical empty plugin-set identity before execution and in their completion
receipts. Legacy completed runs remain readable and are never backfilled.
See [the P4-WP06 portability and packaging contract](docs/P4_WP06_PORTABLE_PROJECTS_PACKAGING.md).

P5-WP03 adds authenticity and separately requested confidentiality around the
unchanged archive bytes. Keys and host trust policy are external files; never
place private keys in a project, archive, repository, fixture, log, or bundle.

```bash
python -m biomesh project secure-archive PROJECT_ARCHIVE.biomesh \
  --output PROJECT_ARCHIVE.secure.biomesh \
  --signer-id SIGNER_ID --signing-private-key ED25519_RAW_PRIVATE_KEY

# Add both options only when confidentiality is explicitly requested:
# --recipient-id RECIPIENT_ID --recipient-public-key X25519_RAW_PUBLIC_KEY

python -m biomesh project verify-secure-archive \
  PROJECT_ARCHIVE.secure.biomesh --trust-policy HOST_TRUST_POLICY.json
python -m biomesh project import-secure-archive \
  PROJECT_ARCHIVE.secure.biomesh NEW_PROJECT_DIRECTORY \
  --trust-policy HOST_TRUST_POLICY.json
```

Confidential verification/import additionally requires `--recipient-id` and
`--recipient-private-key`; `--require-confidentiality` rejects signed plaintext
input. Trust, revocation, validity, and prohibited replay bindings come only
from the strict host policy. Signing and decryption do not grant plugin or
registry trust, execution authorization, calibration, sandboxing, or
scientific validity. See [the P5-WP03 algorithm and envelope policy](docs/P5_WP03_ARCHIVE_SECURITY_POLICY.md).

Build the exact clean-source P5 publication set and verify its wheel, sdist,
Linux installer, and canonical provenance manifest:

```bash
python -m biomesh provenance build --source . --output dist
python -m biomesh provenance verify dist/biomesh-0.5.0-provenance.json
tar -xzf dist/biomesh-*-linux-*.tar.gz
cd biomesh-*-linux-*
./install.sh --install
```

The bundle requires Linux and Python 3.14. It verifies the exact wheel and
build/artifact provenance before prefix mutation, manifests every installed
file, publishes versions side by side, and passes installed CLI help plus
offscreen GUI smoke before atomically changing the current version.

```bash
./install.sh --upgrade
./install.sh --rollback PREVIOUS_VERSION
./install.sh --uninstall VERSION
./install.sh --recover
```

Modified, missing, extra, ambiguous, or ownership-mismatched paths block by
default. Exact `--acknowledge-path STATE:PATH` options and
`--quarantine-modified` retain a changed uninstall tree rather than deleting
unowned bytes. Projects, archives, queues, reports, parameters, configuration,
raw runs, and research results are never installer-owned. See
[the P5-WP05 lifecycle policy](docs/P5_WP05_INSTALLER_LIFECYCLE.md).

Run the isolated benchmark reference, or explicitly enable the CPU-only
feasibility candidate, with:

```bash
python -m biomesh benchmark acceleration
python -m biomesh benchmark acceleration --experimental
python -m biomesh benchmark acceleration --experimental \
  --timing-samples 3 --output NEW_BENCHMARK_DIRECTORY
```

Experimental execution is disabled by default. The fixed case is a synthetic
dimensionless 2D stencil and is not connected to model execution. The report
measures candidate divergence from the CPU reference. Optional timings are raw
local observations only: no speedup, GPU support, 3D validation, production
performance, or scientific accuracy is claimed. See
[the P4-WP07 benchmark contract](docs/P4_WP07_EXPERIMENTAL_ACCELERATION.md).

The Simulation Controls dock selects only the 15 existing manufactured P2
fixture conditions and fixed seeds 101, 202, or 303. Run and checkpoint-resume
remain disabled while the Experiment Editor document is invalid or retains
`CALIBRATION_REQUIRED` values or provenance. The editor document is a UI
eligibility gate only: it is not passed to the frozen application API and no
configuration-to-engine bridge is implied. Pause, step, stop, speed target,
checkpoint, and resume operate at accepted solver boundaries. Clicking a cell
shows its immutable public inspection record; values unavailable from that
record are not inferred from private state.

The Analytics dock plots only immutable public snapshots and their existing
stored metrics. “Strain ratio” is explicitly the stored dimensionless producer
cell frequency; penetration depth retains the separate stored carbon and oxygen
series. File → Export Completed Run creates a new directory containing plot
PNGs, exact long-form CSV and Parquet tables, byte-preserved canonical fields
and tables, canonical run metadata, and a hash-indexed run manifest. Export can
be cancelled before atomic publication; failures leave no partial target.

## Experiment fixtures

The root `experiments/` directory contains the executable manufactured fixture
surface. Use `experiment` for:

- `producer.yaml`, `nonproducer.yaml`, and `competition_50_50.yaml`;
- `inoculation_intermixed.yaml` and `inoculation_segregated.yaml`; and
- `eps_constitutive.yaml` and `eps_quorum_controlled.yaml`.

Use `sweep` for `qs_threshold_sweep.yaml`, `nutrient_oxygen_sweep.yaml`,
`eps_cost_sweep.yaml`, and `shear_sweep.yaml`. Each published condition runs at
fixed seeds 101, 202, and 303. These fixture inputs and their outputs are
software-validation evidence only; the unresolved campaign definition and
biological parameter records remain separately provenance-labelled and
`CALIBRATION_REQUIRED`.

## Roadmap

P4 is accepted. The [pre-v1 roadmap](docs/10_PRE_V1_ROADMAP.md) authorizes five
strictly ordered, audit-blocked phases: security and
distribution hardening, portable operations, calibration and validation, 3D
and accelerated computing, and the final version 1 release. The next package
is `P5-WP03 – Signed and optionally confidential archives`, which must begin in
a fresh task. BioMesh is not called v1, and no post-v1 or new UI work is
authorized.

## License

License selection is pending; no license has been added yet.
